How to create a local repository and upload in into the remote repository
- git init (Initialize a local git repository)
- git add . (Stage all files)
- git commit -m "Initial commit" (Commit files, this will create the first branch ususally named 'main')
Now you have to create a remote repository in the GitHub profile. And link that repository with this local repository.
Below steps are to create a remote GitHub repository.
Once the repository is created grab the http url and use it in the below command
- git remote add origin https://github.com/DebRay24/CI_CD_Practise.git
(Set up the remote repository in the local git repository. Origin is the identifier here.)
- git push (This will through an error that the current main branch has no upstream branch. So, use the below command.)
- git push --set-upstream origin main
Note that the personal access token has been set up on the local machine earlier.
Now your code is uploaded in the remote repository and your local repository is linked to your remote.
